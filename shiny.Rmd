title: Using DT in Shiny
---

---

You can render a table widget in shiny, and obtain some information about its current state, such as the indices of the rows on the current page.

# A Minimal Example

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Version Note:** The behavior of `DT::renderDataTable` changed in version 0.0.65. Please update if you are using an older version.
</div>

Here is a minimal example of (client-side) DataTables in Shiny using the convenience functions `dataTableOutput()` and `renderDataTable()` in the **DT** namespace (instead of **shiny**):

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(DT::dataTableOutput('tbl')),
  server = function(input, output) {
    output$tbl = DT::renderDataTable(
      iris, options = list(lengthChange = FALSE)
    )
  }
)
```

**Important:** Be sure to use the `DT::` prefix when calling `dataTableOutput` and `renderDataTable` so that the **DT** versions of these functions are guaranteed to be called, instead of the deprecated Shiny versions. If you make sure to `library(DT)` _after_ `library(shiny)`, normally the **DT** versions should just override the **shiny** versions if you do not use the `DT::` prefix (when in doubt, use this prefix, until we completely remove these functions from **shiny**).

If you have used the `renderDataTable()` function in **shiny** before, please note you should use `JS()` instead of `I()` to write literal JavaScript code in options.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
shiny::renderDataTable(iris, options = list(
  pageLength = 5,
  initComplete = I('function(setting, json) { alert("done"); }')
))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(DT)
DT::renderDataTable(
  iris, options = list(
    pageLength = 5,
    initComplete = JS('function(setting, json) { alert("done"); }')
  )
)
```

The `renderDataTable()` function in **shiny** uses [server-side processing](server.html) and it has no client-side support. **DT** supports both ways; the default is server-side processing, but you can switch to client-side by calling `DT::renderDataTable` with a `server = FALSE` argument. When the data object is relatively large, do not use `server = FALSE`, otherwise it will be too slow to render the table in the web browser, and the table will not be very responsive, either.

The first argument of `DT::renderDataTable()` can be either a data object or a table widget returned by `datatable()`. The latter form can be useful when you want to manipulate the widget before rendering it in Shiny, e.g. you may apply a formatting function to a table widget:

```{r eval=FALSE}
DT::renderDataTable({
  datatable(iris) %>% formatStyle(
    'Sepal.Width',
    backgroundColor = styleInterval(3.4, c('gray', 'yellow'))
  )
})
```

# Interaction with Shiny

There are some information exposed to Shiny from the table widget as you interact with the table in Shiny. In the following sections, we use `foo` to denote the output id of the table (i.e. the `outputId` in `dataTableOutput()`). You need to replace `foo` with the actual id of the table in your own app.

## Row Selection

The feature of row selection is enabled automatically when a table is embedded in a Shiny app. You can click on a row to toggle its selection status, and the indices of the selected rows are available through `input$foo_rows_selected`. See [a live example here](https://yihui.shinyapps.io/DT-rows/). You can disable row selection by `datatable(..., selection = 'none')`, or use the single selection mode by `selection = 'single'`. The default selection mode is multiple selections (try the table below).

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(DT)
datatable(head(iris), options = list(dom = 't'), callback = JS(
  "table.on('click.dt', 'tbody tr', function() {",
  "$(this).toggleClass('selected');",
  "})"
))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# you can find the example locally in the DT package
app = system.file('examples', 'DT-rows', package = 'DT')
shiny::runApp(app)
```

<div class="panel-heading">Row Indices in the Case of Server-side Processing</div>
<div class="panel-body">
Note `input$foo_rows_selected` is the numeric indices of the selected rows when the table is processed on the client side. For server-side processing, there is no way to obtain the numeric indices because **DT** does not know the full table: only one page of the table data is returned from the server, and we have no idea the n-th row on a page is which row in the full table (by comparison, client-side tables fully live in the web browser). A workaround in this case is to use the row names as the indices. You must turn on the display of row names by `datatable(data, rownames = TRUE)` (in most cases, this is just the default behavior) if you want to get the names of selected rows from `input$foo_rows_selected`.
</div>
</div>

You can also obtain the index of the last clicked row via `input$foo_row_last_clicked` (it may be `NULL` initially and when the table is redrawn).

## DataTables Information

As you interact with the table (e.g. sort columns, search the table, or navigate through pages), **DT** will expose some information about the current state of the table to Shiny. At the moment, these information are available in the `input` object of the Shiny server function (suppose the table output id is `foo`):

- `input$foo_rows_current`: the indices of rows on the current page
- `input$foo_rows_all`: the indices of rows on all pages (after the table is filtered by the search strings)
    - similar to the indices of selected rows, the indices are row names when you use the server-side processing, and numeric indices when using client-side processing
    - again, there is no way to know all the available data on the server side, `input$foo_rows_all` will be the same as `input$foo_rows_current` for tables using server-side processing
- `input$foo_search`: the global search string
- `input$foo_search_columns`: the vector of column search strings when column filters are enabled
- `input$foo_state`: the state information of the table (a list containing the search string, ordering and paging information; it is available only if the option `stateSave = TRUE` is applied to the table)

[This example](https://yihui.shinyapps.io/DT-info/) shows how you can make use of these information to highlight points on a scatterplot and download the filtered data.

```{r eval=FALSE}
app = system.file('examples', 'DT-info', package = 'DT')
shiny::runApp(app)
```
